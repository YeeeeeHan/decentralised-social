# Decentralised Social

You are tasked to build a decentralized Twitter, BE, FE, entire stack. And you are alone, and within 4 weeks.

- Can you clearly describe the design and the whole process. Feel free to include mockup, diagrams, cryptography design and anything else that explain your ideas clearly.
- With the above process, do you think it can be done within 4 weeks? What are the tradeoffs that are made because of time factor.

# Brief Overview

## The case for decentralised social networks

### Introduction

Before embarking on the task to build a decentralised twitter/social network, I would like to first examine the case for building a decentralised social network, and understand what are some features that would make a decentralised twitter superior to that of its web2 counterpart.

By first acknowledging its strengths and weaknesses, we can subsequently strive to amplify its benefits and work around its shortcomings in order to build an end product that would entice existing users to migrate over.

Being aware of the inherent differences between the decentralised and web2 products would also allow us to take the best parts of the current implementation, while avoiding the situation where we re-invent the wheel.

### Benefits of decentralised social networks

I have identified 3 main benefits of social networks:

1. Owning your audience and content
   - your audience will follow you across different applications
   - Users can monetize their own contents
2. Prevents social discourse from being controlled by a small group of people - related to algorithm
3. ZK proves - ability to say and prove something anonymously

## Assumptions surrounding the task

1. Use Lens protocol
